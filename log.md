# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 6, 2017 
#####

**Today's Progress**:
Good start. Laid out a bunch of projects and using FCC to learn new web design languages

**Thoughts:**
Feels pretty good to have a game plan laid out so I can complete the 100 days of code. Still need to learn how to use github instead of going to the site and changing directly on the site.

### Day 1: February 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 

started day working on resume layout.

2nd attempt at Free code camp trubute page

replied to and read discussions on free code camp forum

**Thoughts** 

I think this was a very productive day. I think that I may have a handle on bootstrap layout. I still do not feel as comfortable with it as I do HTML and CSS. I defintately know where I was missing steps beofre and plan on revisiting resume again to update with bootstrap.

### Day 2: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 

Plan for today:

1. continue layout for tribute page

2. update resume with my information/picture

3. sketch out layout for portfolio

4. start basic code for portfolio

5. work on FCC javascript segments


**Thoughts** 

Did not get to start until late in the evening so was only to work for an hour, however I did get it in. I meet 3 of the 5 goals above. I was able to sketch layout for portfolio, do a basic layout based on draft for portfolio using bootstrap and continued updating information and layout for tribute page. I also did some reading of the Bootstrap documentation and it is starting make a little more sense to me.

**Today's Progress**: 


**Thoughts** 

Was able to get almost 2 hours in today again using bootstrap. Read some moe Bootstrap documentation to help with the layout of my FCC portfoli. I am having a pretty rough time being able to use a photo from a local file as my background, but I will get it figured out. Overall, I like how things are coming along.
